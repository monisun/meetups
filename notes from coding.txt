first solve for n = 3:

1. input 3 GPS locations AND a venue category
2. find geo mean of triangle
3. call Yelp API: location, radius, find OpenNow, venue type
4. show results
5. yelp API has: term (any search string) and categories (defined)



debugging notes:
1.
GET /javascripts/meetup-ui.js 200 6ms - 1.34kb
PUT /addlocation/1 404 15ms - 1.24kb

this means 404, router.put(...) is not correctly set up.

2. creating 2dsphere indexes:

> db.collection.ensureIndex({ "gps" : "2dsphere" })
{
	"createdCollectionAutomatically" : true,
	"numIndexesBefore" : 1,
	"numIndexesAfter" : 2,
	"ok" : 1
}
> 


3. change input such that it's a single input textbox & always adding a new GPS location.

4. make categories available
5. address, zip code, more flexible addresses
